# Triage Steps

This class fires on actions that touch logging and detection controls — and those controls get edited, re-tuned, and re-applied all day by automation and admins doing legitimate work, so a control changing is not the signal. The signal is who touched it and whether they adjusted it or destroyed it: attackers blind the account before they act, so a control going fully dark is one of the higher-stakes shapes in this domain, but a routine re-config that leaves the control intact is not. Triage here is reading that difference and deciding whether the change looks like managed operations or like someone clearing the way — escalate or dismiss. This class turns on blinding the account's visibility — disabling or deleting the logging and detection configuration itself, the trail, the detector, the flow-log setup — distinct from breaking data protection or destroying data, which is a different class. Deleting the trail or stopping logging is this class; a destructive wipe of the store that holds the logs — mass-deleting the objects in the audit-log bucket or vault — is a data wipe that belongs to the destruction class by its activity.

Start from this detection's track record on this actor and control — a re-tuning rule that fires whenever the detection owner adjusts thresholds and is always closed benign starts the call near dismiss — then read the leads below. None is required on its own; they stack, and a single strong one (a hard delete of the only audit trail by an unexpected actor) can carry the call.

**Leads that point to a real threat** — what to look for in the data:

- **The control destroyed, not adjusted.** A delete or hard disable rather than a documented re-config: `DeleteTrail`, `StopLogging`, `DeleteDetector`, `DeleteFlowLogs`, disabling Security Hub. Re-tuning leaves the control running; tearing it down removes the record entirely.
- **An actor that shouldn't be touching it.** The change comes from an actor not on the approved-admin or automation list, or one that has never managed this control — a compute or user identity disabling the audit trail, not the CI role that owns it. The identity directory (Graph/Okta users, directory-roles, service-principals) tells you which kind of identity you are looking at.
- **The account's only eyes go dark.** The action hits the primary or sole logging path or the main detection tooling — `PutEventSelectors` narrowing the trail to nothing, suppressing all findings — leaving no fallback record, rather than one of several redundant sinks. The resource posture (Wiz high-business-impact, public-exposure) shows what that coverage was protecting.
- **It clusters with other moves.** The same actor in the same window also makes an IAM grant, pulls a secret, or changes another security control. A control going dark right before or after other control-plane activity by one actor is the strongest tell — that chain is what clearing-the-way looks like.

**Leads that rule it out** — benign context you can actually see in the data; if the data doesn't show it, you don't have it:

- **The actor explains it.** A known infrastructure-as-code or automation identity — including provider service-linked roles — or a confirmed admin acting inside a change or maintenance window.
- **It matches the baseline.** The same actor routinely manages this exact control; a logging sink reconfigured but left intact, a detection re-tuned by its owner, a firewall rule edited and re-applied by the CI role.
- **Adjusted, not destroyed.** The control was re-tuned or reconfigured and is still running, not deleted or hard-disabled, and another logging path or detection control still covers the account.
- **Broad rollout, not a single target.** The same reconfiguration lands across many accounts or regions on a managed cadence — the shape of policy rollout; clearing the way hits one account's controls.
- **Clean history.** Prior dispositions for a known-noisy reconfiguration rule on this actor and control closed benign, with nothing new in the change this time.

To confirm a lead instead of guessing, pull the thread: did the same actor make an IAM grant, pull a secret, or move data in the same window after the control went dark? Corroboration turns a suspicious disable into a confirmed one.

# Output

## Decision
- **escalate:** the primary audit trail or a detection control is deleted or hard-disabled by an actor not on the approved-admin/automation list, outside a maintenance window, or the change is a deletion rather than a documented re-config — especially when it chains with other control-plane activity by the same actor.
- **dismiss:** a known automation or confirmed admin reconfigures a control it normally manages, inside a change window, leaving it running and other coverage intact. A dismiss is a positive call that the change is benign, made with that context in hand — an actor you confirmed manages this control, a change window or re-tuning pattern you actually saw; an actor you couldn't resolve or a change record you couldn't find is not that context, and absence of a bad sign is not proof it's good. Dismiss is logged and reopenable; when the benign context is missing or you're unsure — or a primary control is destroyed by an unexpected actor — escalate.

## Evidence
The actor and whether it is a confirmed admin, automation, service-linked, or unexpected identity; whether the action was a delete/disable or a reconfiguration; which control was touched and whether it is the account's primary one; change-window and baseline fit; prior dispositions for the rule; and any sibling control-plane activity by the same actor.

## Reasoning
Name the leads that decided it and how they stacked — a compute role calling DeleteTrail outside any window, then granting itself a policy, is escalate on its own; the CI role re-tuning a detection it owns inside a change window, with logging left intact, is dismiss.
