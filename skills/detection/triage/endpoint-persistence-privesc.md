# Triage Steps

This class fires on actions that real software performs all day — installers register services, deployment tools create scheduled tasks, agents write run-key entries, and admins add accounts to privileged groups. Installer churn is the loudest benign source here, so the fact that a persistence mechanism was written is not the signal. The signal is who wrote it and what it points at: a known deployment tool pointing a well-named service at its own signed binary reads very differently from an unexpected account pointing a task at a script in a temp folder. Triage here is reading that pairing and deciding whether this is a managed change or someone planting a foothold or quietly elevating.

Start from this detection's track record on this actor and host — a rule that fires on every patch cycle and always closes benign starts the call near dismiss — then read the leads below. None is required on its own; they stack, and one strong lead (a worker process writing a web shell, an unsigned DLL dropped ahead of a load) can carry the call. When a web shell write co-fires with a defense-evasion tamper alert on the same host, the evasion-tamper skill owns the call only if tampering is the primary act; persistence owns it when the write itself is the primary signal.

**Leads that point to a real threat** — what to look for in the data:

- **Unexpected actor creating the mechanism.** A low-privilege user, a service account, or a SYSTEM context spawned by an odd parent registering persistence: `sc create svc binPath= C:\Users\Public\x.exe`, `schtasks /create /ru SYSTEM /tr ...` from a non-admin shell. The actor's role, not the mechanism, is the tell — real persistence is created by deployment tooling and admins.
- **Payload in a writable or wrong place.** The service, task, or `Run`-key value points at an unsigned binary, a renamed system tool, or a script interpreter whose argument is a script sitting under `\Temp`, `\Downloads`, `%PUBLIC%`, or `C:\ProgramData` instead of a vendor install path: `reg add HKCU\...\Run /v upd /d "%TEMP%\a.vbs"`. A malicious or suspicious verdict on the payload's hash makes the wrong-place read decisive; unexpected actor plus a payload in a writable location is escalate.
- **Library search-order drop.** An unsigned or unrecognized DLL placed in a directory that takes load precedence over the real path, not explained by any software deploy, especially one written just before or after another odd event on the host. When a process then loads from that path, the pair is escalate without further conditions.
- **Bypass or rights grant with no visible approval.** A consent-prompt or auto-elevation chain that skips the approval step (`fodhelper.exe`, an env-var hijack feeding an auto-elevating binary), or a high-privilege group add or sensitive-right grant observed on the host or its domain controller outside a change window — adding an account to a local or Active Directory group, or granting it the ability to act for other accounts on this host. The bypass pattern itself is the escalator.

**Leads that rule it out** — benign context you can actually see in the data; if the data doesn't show it, you don't have it:

- **The actor explains it.** A confirmed admin or a deployment/management service account whose role and history include creating this exact mechanism on this host — the identity directory (Graph/Okta users, directory-roles) confirms the role, not the account name.
- **It matches the host's baseline.** The same service, task, or run-key entry, with the same payload path, exists as a known-good entry here already.
- **Signed payload in its install path.** The service or task points at a vendor-signed binary under `C:\Program Files\...`, not a copy dropped in a user or temp folder.
- **Fleet-wide, not single-target.** The identical mechanism and payload path appear across many hosts on a deploy or patch cadence — the shape of management, which rolls out broadly; an intrusion plants on one or a few.
- **Clean history with a deploy that fits.** This rule has closed benign on this host before, and a software install or patch cycle on record explains the timing this time.

To confirm a lead instead of guessing, pull the thread: did the registered binary later run, did a process load from the dropped path, or did the newly privileged account take an action in the same window? Corroboration turns a suspicious write into a confirmed foothold.

# Output

## Decision
- **escalate:** an unexpected actor creating the mechanism, a payload in a writable or wrong place, a search-order DLL drop, or a bypass or rights grant with no visible approval — especially two together, or any one followed by the payload running.
- **dismiss:** a confirmed admin or deployment service account, a baseline match, or a signed payload in its install path explains it, with a deploy or patch cycle that fits the timing and no writable-path payload or bypass pattern. A dismiss is a positive call that the mechanism is benign, made with that context in hand — a deployment account's install history you verified, a matching run-key entry you actually saw; an actor you couldn't confirm or a baseline you couldn't establish is not that context, and absence of a bad sign is not proof it's good. Dismiss is logged and reopenable; when the actor or payload path looks wrong, nothing explains it, or you're unsure, escalate.

## Evidence
The actor creating the mechanism and its role, the mechanism type and where its payload lives (vendor install path vs temp or interpreter), whether it is a standard service or task vs a bypass chain or web shell, whether it matches the host baseline or a fleet-wide rollout, the host's role from the asset inventory (Axonius, managed-devices), and how this rule was handled here before.

## Reasoning
Name the leads that decided it and how they stacked — an unexpected account pointing a scheduled task at a temp-folder script is escalate, while a signed installer registering its own service across the fleet on a patch cadence is dismiss.
