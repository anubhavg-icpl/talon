# 2.2.9 Ensure HTTP server is not installed (Automated)

## Profile

- Level 1 - Server
- Level 1 - Workstation

## Description

HTTP or web servers provide the ability to host web site content.

## Rationale

Unless there is a need to run the system as a web server, it is recommended that the package be deleted to reduce the potential attack surface.

## Audit Procedure

### Command Line

Run the following command to verify `apache2` is not installed:

```bash
# dpkg-query -s apache2 &>/dev/null && echo "apache2 is installed"
```

Nothing should be returned.

## Expected Result

No output (empty result).

## Remediation

### Command Line

Run the following command to remove `apache2`:

```bash
# apt purge apache2
```

## References

1. NIST SP 800-53 Rev. 5: CM-7

Additional Information:

Several httpd servers exist and can use other service names. `apache2` and `nginx` are example services that provide an HTTP server. These and other services should also be audited.
