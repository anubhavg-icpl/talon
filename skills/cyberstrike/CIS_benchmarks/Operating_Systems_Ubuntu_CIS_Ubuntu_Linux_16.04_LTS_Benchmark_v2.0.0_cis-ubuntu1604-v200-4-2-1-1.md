## Description

The `rsyslog` software is a recommended replacement to the original `syslogd` daemon which provide improvements over `syslogd`, such as connection-oriented (i.e. TCP) transmission of logs, the option to log to database formats, and the encryption of log data en route to a central logging server.

## Rationale

The security enhancements of `rsyslog` such as connection-oriented (i.e. TCP) transmission of logs, the option to log to database formats, and the encryption of log data en route to a central logging server) justify installing and configuring the package.

## Impact

None.

## Audit Procedure

Verify either rsyslog or syslog-ng is installed. Use the following command to provide the needed information:

### Command Line

## Remediation

Install rsyslog:

### Command Line

```bash
apt install rsyslog
```

## Default Value

rsyslog is installed by default on Ubuntu 16.04.
