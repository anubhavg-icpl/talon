# 9.3.7 Set SSH HostbasedAuthentication to No (Scored)

## Profile Applicability

- Level 1

## Description

The `HostbasedAuthentication` parameter specifies if authentication is allowed through trusted hosts via the user of `.rhosts`, or `/etc/hosts.equiv`, along with successful public key client host authentication. This option only applies to SSH Protocol Version 2.

## Rationale

Even though the `.rhosts` files are ineffective if support is disabled in `/etc/pam.conf`, disabling the ability to use `.rhosts` files in SSH provides an additional layer of protection.

## Audit Procedure

### Using Command Line

To verify the correct SSH setting, run the following command and verify that the output is as shown:

```bash
grep "^HostbasedAuthentication" /etc/ssh/sshd_config
```

## Expected Result

```
HostbasedAuthentication no
```

## Remediation

### Using Command Line

Edit the `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` file to set the parameter as follows:

```bash
HostbasedAuthentication no
```

## Default Value

HostbasedAuthentication no
