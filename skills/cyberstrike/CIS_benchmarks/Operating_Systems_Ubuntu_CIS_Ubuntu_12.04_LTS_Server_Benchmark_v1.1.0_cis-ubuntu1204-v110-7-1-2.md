# 7.1.2 Disable Send Packet Redirects (Scored)

## Profile Applicability

- Level 1

## Description

ICMP Redirects are used to send routing information to other hosts. As a host itself does not act as a router (in a host only configuration), there is no need to send redirects.

## Rationale

An attacker could use a compromised host to send invalid ICMP redirects to other router devices in an attempt to corrupt routing and have users access a system set up by the attacker as opposed to a valid system.

## Audit Procedure

### Using Command Line

Perform the following to determine if send packet redirects is disabled.

```bash
/sbin/sysctl net.ipv4.conf.all.send_redirects
/sbin/sysctl net.ipv4.conf.default.send_redirects
```

## Expected Result

```
net.ipv4.conf.all.send_redirects = 0
net.ipv4.conf.default.send_redirects = 0
```

## Remediation

### Using Command Line

Set the `net.ipv4.conf.all.send_redirects` and `net.ipv4.conf.default.send_redirects` parameters to 0 in `/etc/sysctl.conf`:

```bash
net.ipv4.conf.all.send_redirects=0
net.ipv4.conf.default.send_redirects=0
```

Modify active kernel parameters to match:

```bash
/sbin/sysctl -w net.ipv4.conf.all.send_redirects=0
/sbin/sysctl -w net.ipv4.conf.default.send_redirects=0
/sbin/sysctl -w net.ipv4.route.flush=1
```

## Default Value

Send redirects are enabled by default.
