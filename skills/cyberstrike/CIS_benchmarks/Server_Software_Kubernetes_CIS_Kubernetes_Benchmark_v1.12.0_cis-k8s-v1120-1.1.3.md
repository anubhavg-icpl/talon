# 1.1.3 Ensure that the controller manager pod specification file permissions are set to 600 or more restrictive (Automated)

## Profile Applicability

- Level 1 - Master Node

## Description

Ensure that the controller manager pod specification file has permissions of `600` or more restrictive.

## Rationale

The controller manager pod specification file controls various parameters that set the behavior of the Controller Manager on the master node. You should restrict its file permissions to maintain the integrity of the file. The file should be writable by only the administrators on the system.

## Impact

None

## Audit

Run the below command (based on the file location on your system) on the Control Plane node. For example,

```bash
stat -c %a /etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-controller-manager.yaml
```

Verify that the permissions are `600` or more restrictive.

## Remediation

Run the below command (based on the file location on your system) on the Control Plane node. For example,

```bash
chmod 600 /etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-controller-manager.yaml
```

## Default Value

By default, the `kube-controller-manager.yaml` file has permissions of `640`.
