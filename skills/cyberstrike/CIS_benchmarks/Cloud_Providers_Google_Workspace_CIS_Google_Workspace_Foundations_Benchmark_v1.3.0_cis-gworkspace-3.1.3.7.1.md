# Ensure comprehensive mail storage is enabled (Manual)

## Description

Comprehensive mail storage ensures messages sent by other core services appear in users' sent folders and are therefore accessible to Vault.

## Rationale

As an administrator, you can ensure that a copy of all sent or received messages in your domain--including messages sent or received by non-Gmail mailboxes--is stored in the associated users' Gmail mailboxes.

## Impact

There are some important considerations to carefully review before enabling comprehensive mail storage:

- You should not enable comprehensive mail storage if you have compliance routing rules that change the recipient (and don't want the original recipient to receive a copy of the email).
- When you have the SMTP Relay service enabled, user mailboxes will keep a copy of the message in the sent folder (for example, when sending mail from a scanner) if comprehensive mail storage is enabled. This might cause accounts to exceed storage limits if your account's edition has storage limits.
- You should enable comprehensive mail storage if you only use Gmail for the Vault feature and forward email to your on-premise mail server or other email provider.
