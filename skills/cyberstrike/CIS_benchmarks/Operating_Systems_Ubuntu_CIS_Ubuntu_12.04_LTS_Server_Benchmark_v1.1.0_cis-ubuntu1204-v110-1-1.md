# 1.1 Install Updates, Patches and Additional Security Software (Not Scored)

## Profile Applicability

- Level 1

## Description

Periodically patches are released for included software either due to security flaws or to include additional functionality.

## Rationale

Newer patches may contain security enhancements that would not be available through the latest full update. As a result, it is recommended that the latest software patches be used to take advantage of the latest functionality. As with any software installation, organizations need to determine if a given update meets their requirements and verify the compatibility and supportability of any additional software against the update revision that is selected.

## Audit Procedure

### Using Command Line

```bash
apt-get update
apt-get --just-print upgrade
```

## Expected Result

If there are no packages to update, the system is up to date. If packages are listed, they should be reviewed and applied as appropriate.

## Remediation

### Using Command Line

```bash
apt-get upgrade
```

## Default Value

By default, Ubuntu does not automatically install updates.
