# 7.5.2 Disable SCTP (Not Scored)

## Profile Applicability

- Level 1

## Description

The Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) is a transport layer protocol used to support message oriented communication, with several streams of messages in one connection. It serves a similar function as TCP and UDP, incorporating features of both. It is message-oriented like UDP, and ensures reliable in-sequence transport of messages with congestion control like TCP.

## Rationale

If the protocol is not being used, it is recommended that kernel module not be loaded, disabling the service to reduce the potential attack surface.

## Audit Procedure

### Using Command Line

Perform the following to determine if SCTP is disabled.

```bash
grep "install sctp /bin/true" /etc/modprobe.d/CIS.conf
```

## Expected Result

```
install sctp /bin/true
```

## Remediation

### Using Command Line

```bash
echo "install sctp /bin/true" >> /etc/modprobe.d/CIS.conf
```

## Default Value

SCTP kernel module is available by default.
