# 7.5.1 Disable DCCP (Not Scored)

## Profile Applicability

- Level 1

## Description

The Datagram Congestion Control Protocol (DCCP) is a transport layer protocol that supports streaming media and telephony. DCCP provides a way to gain access to congestion control, without having to do it at the application layer, but does not provide insequence delivery.

## Rationale

If the protocol is not required, it is recommended that the drivers not be installed to reduce the potential attack surface.

## Audit Procedure

### Using Command Line

Perform the following to determine if DCCP is disabled.

```bash
grep "install dccp /bin/true" /etc/modprobe.d/CIS.conf
```

## Expected Result

```
install dccp /bin/true
```

## Remediation

### Using Command Line

```bash
echo "install dccp /bin/true" >> /etc/modprobe.d/CIS.conf
```

## Default Value

DCCP kernel module is available by default.
