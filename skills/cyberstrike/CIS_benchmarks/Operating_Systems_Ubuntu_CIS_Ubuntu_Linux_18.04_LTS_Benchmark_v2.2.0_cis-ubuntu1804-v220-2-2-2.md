# 2.2.2 Ensure Avahi Server is not installed (Automated)

## Profile

- Level 1 - Server
- Level 1 - Workstation

## Description

Avahi is a free zeroconf implementation, including a system for multicast DNS/DNS-SD service discovery. Avahi allows programs to publish and discover services and hosts running on a local network with no specific configuration. For example, a user can plug a computer into a network and Avahi automatically finds printers to print to, files to look at and people to talk to, as well as network services running on the machine.

## Rationale

Automatic discovery of network services is not normally required for system functionality. It is recommended to remove this package to reduce the potential attack surface.

## Audit Procedure

### Command Line

Run the following command to verify `avahi-daemon` is not installed:

```bash
# dpkg-query -s avahi-daemon &>/dev/null && echo "avahi-daemon is installed"
```

Nothing should be returned.

## Expected Result

No output (empty result).

## Remediation

### Command Line

Run the following commands to remove `avahi-daemon`:

```bash
# systemctl stop avahi-daemon.service
# systemctl stop avahi-daemon.socket
# apt purge avahi-daemon
```
