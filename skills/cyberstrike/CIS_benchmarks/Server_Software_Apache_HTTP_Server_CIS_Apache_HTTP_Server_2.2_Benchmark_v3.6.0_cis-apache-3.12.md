# Ensure Group Write Access for the Document Root Directories and Files Is Properly Restricted

## Description

The Apache Document Root directory `$DOCROOT` may need to be writeable by an authorized group such as development, support, or a production content management tool. However, it is important that the Apache group used to run the server does not have write access to any directories or files in the document root.

## Rationale

Preventing Apache from writing to the web document root helps mitigate risk associated with web application vulnerabilities associated with file uploads or command execution. Typically, if an application hosted by Apache needs to write to a directory, it is best practice to have that directory live outside the web root.

## Impact

None documented

## Audit Procedure

Verify that there are no files or directories in the Apache Document Root directory with Apache group write access:

```
## Define $GRP to be the Apache group configured
# GRP=$(grep '^Group' $APACHE_PREFIX/conf/httpd.conf | cut -d' ' -f2)
# find -L $DOCROOT -group $GRP -perm /g=w -ls
```

## Remediation

Perform the following to remove group write access on the `$DOCROOT` directories and files for the `apache` group:

```
# find -L $DOCROOT -group $GRP -perm /g=w -print | xargs chmod g-w
```

## Default Value

None documented
