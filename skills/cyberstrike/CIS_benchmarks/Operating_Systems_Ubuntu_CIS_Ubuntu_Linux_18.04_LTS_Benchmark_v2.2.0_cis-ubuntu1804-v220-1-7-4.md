# 1.7.4 Ensure permissions on /etc/motd are configured (Automated)

## Profile Applicability

- Level 1 - Server
- Level 1 - Workstation

## Description

The contents of the `/etc/motd` file are displayed to users after login and function as a message of the day for authenticated users.

## Rationale

If the `/etc/motd` file does not have the correct ownership it could be modified by unauthorized users with incorrect or misleading information.

## Audit Procedure

### Command Line

Run the following command and verify that if `/etc/motd` exists, `Access` is `644` or more restrictive, `Uid` and `Gid` are both `0/root`:

```bash
[ -e /etc/motd ] && stat -Lc 'Access: (%#a/%A) Uid: ( %u/ %U) Gid: ( %g/ %G)' /etc/motd
```

## Expected Result

```
Access: (0644/-rw-r--r--) Uid: ( 0/ root) Gid: ( 0/ root)
  -- OR --
Nothing is returned
```

## Remediation

### Command Line

Run the following commands to set permissions on `/etc/motd`:

```bash
chown root:root $(readlink -e /etc/motd)
chmod u-x,go-wx $(readlink -e /etc/motd)
```

-- OR --

Run the following command to remove the `/etc/motd` file:

```bash
rm /etc/motd
```

## Default Value

File doesn't exist

## Additional Information

If Message of the day is not needed, this file can be removed.
