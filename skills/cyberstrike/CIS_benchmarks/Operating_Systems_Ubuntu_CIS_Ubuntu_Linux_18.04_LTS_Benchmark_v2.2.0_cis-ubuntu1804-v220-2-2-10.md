# 2.2.10 Ensure IMAP and POP3 server are not installed (Automated)

## Profile

- Level 1 - Server
- Level 1 - Workstation

## Description

`dovecot-imapd` and `dovecot-pop3d` are an open source IMAP and POP3 server for Linux based systems.

## Rationale

Unless POP3 and/or IMAP servers are to be provided by this system, it is recommended that the package be removed to reduce the potential attack surface.

## Audit Procedure

### Command Line

Run the following command to verify `dovecot-imapd` is not installed:

```bash
# dpkg-query -s dovecot-imapd &>/dev/null && echo "dovecot-imapd is installed"
```

Nothing should be returned.

Run the following command to verify `dovecot-pop3d` is not installed:

```bash
# dpkg-query -s dovecot-pop3d &>/dev/null && echo "dovecot-pop3d is installed"
```

Nothing should be returned.

## Expected Result

No output (empty result) for both commands.

## Remediation

### Command Line

Run one of the following commands to remove `dovecot-imapd` and `dovecot-pop3d`:

```bash
# apt purge dovecot-imapd dovecot-pop3d
```

Additional Information:

Several IMAP/POP3 servers exist and can use other service names. `courier-imap` and `cyrus-imap` are example services that provide a mail server. These and other services should also be audited.
