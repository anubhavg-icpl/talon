# 12.5 Verify User/Group Ownership on /etc/shadow (Scored)

## Profile Applicability

- Level 1

## Description

The `/etc/shadow` file contains the one-way cipher text passwords for each user defined in the `/etc/passwd` file. The command below sets the user and group ownership of the file to root.

## Rationale

If attackers can gain read access to the `/etc/shadow` file, they can easily run a password cracking program against the hashed password to break it. Other security information that is stored in the `/etc/shadow` file (such as expiration) could also be useful to subvert the user accounts.

## Audit Procedure

### Using Command Line

Run the following command to determine the ownership of the `/etc/shadow` file. Ensure it is owned by user root, and group root or shadow.

```bash
/bin/ls -l /etc/shadow
```

## Expected Result

```
-rw-r----- 1 root shadow <size> <date> shadow
```

Owner should be `root` and group should be `root` or `shadow`.

## Remediation

### Using Command Line

If the ownership of the `/etc/shadow` file is incorrect, run the following command to correct them:

```bash
/bin/chown root:shadow /etc/shadow
```

## Default Value

root:shadow
