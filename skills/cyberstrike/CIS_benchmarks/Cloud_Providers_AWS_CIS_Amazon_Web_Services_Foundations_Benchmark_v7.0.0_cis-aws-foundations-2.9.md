# Ensure IAM password policy prevents password reuse

## Description

IAM password policies can prevent the reuse of passwords by the same user. It is recommended that the password policy be configured to prevent password reuse.

## Rationale

Preventing password reuse increases account resilience against brute force and credential reuse attacks.

## Impact

Allowing password reuse increases the risk of account compromise, particularly if previously exposed or weak passwords are reused.

## Audit Procedure

### Using AWS Console

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the IAM console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam.
2. Click on `Account Settings` on the left Pane.
3. Ensure `Prevent password reuse` is checked.
4. Ensure `Remember XX password(s)` is set appropriately (e.g., 24 or greater).

### Using AWS CLI

1. Run the following command:

```bash
aws iam get-account-password-policy
```

2. Ensure the output includes:

```json
"PasswordReusePrevention": 24
```

## Expected Result

The IAM password policy has `PasswordReusePrevention` set to `24` or greater.

## Remediation

### Using AWS Console

1. Login to AWS Console (with appropriate permissions to View Identity Access Management Account Settings).
2. Go to `IAM Service`.
3. Select `Account Settings` on the left Pane.
4. Check `Prevent password reuse`.
5. Set `Remember XX password(s)` to **24 or greater**.

### Using AWS CLI

1. Run the following command:

```bash
aws iam update-account-password-policy --password-reuse-prevention 24
```

**Note:** All commands starting with "aws iam update-account-password-policy" can be combined into a single command.

## Default Value

By default, the AWS IAM password policy does not prevent password reuse. No password history is maintained unless explicitly configured.
